<p><strong>The Brandish Services</strong></p>
<p>Brandish is a platform that allows the User to build a better brand by using analytics, metrics, reports and dashboards to establish, broaden and strengthen its brand.</p>
<p>Brandish solely provides a platform for Users and their clients (“Clients”) as a medium to use its software, analytics, metrics, reports and dashboards to expand and efficiently build the Users brand. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Users.</p>
<p>Brandish does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Services provided by Users or Clients nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users or Clients. Brandish makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to services offered or provided by Users or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any User. You understand that Brandish does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Brandish does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Users on the Services. Brandish does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Brandish may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Users via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a User based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not Brandish conducts a background check or first party interview on a User, each Client must decide whether a User is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. </p>

By entering your payment information when requested, you authorize Brandish and its payment processors to charge and process the fees and charges assessed in connection with your order in accordance with the policy described on the User's Brandish page at the time of your payment. While Brandish takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, Brandish is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment </p>

Ideally, the Account ID you choose will be a reasonably descriptive name that clearly identifies you. We reserve the right to remove or reclaim any Account ID if we believe, in our sole discretion, the Account ID is inappropriate, offensive or confusing or potentially violates the rights of a third party (such as when a trademark owner provides notice that an Account ID is similar to the trademark and the Account ID does not closely relate to the User's actual name or trademark rights).</p>

<p><blockquote>Brandish's Role</blockquote></p>
<p>The Services allow Clients and Users to make payments for Services, including Card-based payments initiated with Cards bearing the trademarks of MasterCard International Inc. and Visa Inc. (collectively, the “Networks”) through a payment service provider retained by the Company (the “PSP”). We are not a bank and we do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. </p>
<p>Brandish facilitates the processing of payments Users receive from Clients. This means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments. </p>
<p><i>Authorization</i> </p>
<p>You authorize us to process payments in accordance with the Services, using the payment information you have supplied. Users of the Service will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Company and the PSP. </p>
<p>Within 24 hours after you receive confirmation through the Service, you agree to authorize the Company to provide your payment details to the PSP for processing of payments, out of pocket expenses owed to a User, and the service fees and trust and safety fees owed to Company for the use of the Service. </p>
<p><i>Third Party Payment Service Provider</i> </p>
<p>Users will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to the Company and the PSP. As a condition of Brandish enabling payment processing services through the PSP, you agree to provide Brandish accurate and complete information about you and/or your business, and you authorize Brandish to share it and transaction information related to your use of the PSP services. </p>
<p>Brandish uses [Square, Inc. (Square) for payment processing services. By using the Square payment processing services you agree to Square's Terms of Service available at <u>https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/ua</u>. Brandish also uses Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. (Braintree) for payment processing services. By using the Braintree payment processing services you agree to the Braintree Payment Services Agreement available at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/gateway-agreement, and the applicable bank agreement available at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/cea-wells.]</p>
<p>Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so. </p>
<p><i>Unauthorized or Illegal Use</i> </p>
<p>We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe in our sole discretion that the transaction is in violation of these Terms of Service or any other Brandish agreement, or that it exposes Users, other Brandish Users, the PSP or Brandish to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts as determined by Brandish in our sole discretion. If we reasonably suspect that your Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement. </p>
<p><i>Accepted Cards</i> </p>
<p>Brandish works with any US-issued and most non-US issued credit, debit, prepaid, or gift cards (“Cards”) with a Visa, MasterCard, or Discover logo. We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice. We will generally only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network and Card issuer. </p>
<p><i>Brandish Fees</i> </p>
<p>If applicable, you agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule available by contacting us at support@brandishinishts.com for use of the Services (“Fees”).
